        We are using icons that we are obtaining from a content delivery network.
        ? The syntax for accessing them is:
        ? <i class="name of icon" />
        * Like this:
        ? <i class="fab fa-500px" />

        ! Also note that the size of these icons is influenced by the 'font-size' property, even though these are SVG images.

    <!-- It is important for the script tag to be placed as the last thing in the body tag. 
    
    Otherwise, the JS would run before the elements are rendered to the DOM.
    
    Resultingly, the array we create/any other operation we perform from the HTMLCollection of elements of a certain class name would be empty because the DOM wouldn't be containing the required elements at the time of array creation. -->
